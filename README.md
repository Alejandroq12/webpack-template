<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## 💻 Getting Started <a name="getting-started"></a>

To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

To work with this project, you need:

1. A modern web browser to view the website (e.g., Google Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Microsoft Edge).

2. A code editor for editing the code, such as Visual Studio Code, Atom, or Sublime Text.

3. Node.js installed on your machine. You can download the latest version [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

4. npm (Node Package Manager) installed, which comes bundled with Node.js.

5. After cloning the project, make sure to run npm install to install all the necessary dependencies, including Luxon and linters, specified in the package.json file.

### Setup

Clone this repository to your desired folder:

1. Clone it using your terminal:
```
git clone https://github.com/Alejandroq12/webpack-template.git
```

2. If the previous method does not work you may also download the repo as a .zip file and once you decompress the .zip file you are ready to use it.

Important: do not forget to clone the repo in the correct folder, probably you will use the following commands to achieve that in your terminal:

1. To navigate a certain folder:

```
cd <folder name>
```
2. To navigate to the previous folder: 

```
cd ..
```

### Install

Install this project with:


1. Complete the following steps:

```
npm init -y
npm install

```

3. If you run npm install, remember to create a .gitignore file to prevent the node_modules folder from being uploaded to GitHub:

```
.gitignore
node_modules/
```

### Usage

To use this project locally on your computer, follow these steps:


1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Navigate to the project directory where the files are located.
3. Go to the terminal and run:

-- This command will run the development mode:
```
npm start
```
-- This command will run the production mode:
```
npm run build
```

The website should now be displayed in your browser, and you can interact with the application as intended.

### Run tests

1. I did not include linters because this ons is just a template.

### Deployment

You can deploy this project using GitHub pages:

1. Log in to your GitHub account and navigate to the repository that contains your website files.
2. Make sure that your website files are located in the main branch and in the root directory of the repository.
3. If your website is not already live, make sure that the index.html file is the main page of your website.
4. Click on the "Settings" tab in your repository.
5. Scroll down to the "GitHub Pages" section.
6. In the "Source" dropdown menu, select the branch where your website files are located. For a simple website with only HTML and CSS, this is typically the main branch.
7. In the "Path" field, make sure that the root directory is specified (i.e., "/").
8. Click "Save" to generate your website.
9. Wait a few minutes for GitHub to build and deploy your website.
10. Once the website is deployed, visit the GitHub Pages URL to view your site.
